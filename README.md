# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot-
This project showcases an obstacle avoidance robot using an ESP32 microcontroller andes source code ,its accessible for both beginners and experi various sensors, including ultrasonic, infrared, to autonomously navigate its environment and avoid obstacles in real-time.



Features

ESP32 Microcontroller: Utilizes the powerful and versatile ESP32 for controlling the robot and processing sensor data.

Ultrasonic Sensors: Employed for measuring the distance to obstacles using sound waves, offering reliable detection of objects in close proximity.

Infrared Sensors: Used to detect obstacles by measuring the reflection of infrared light, allowing for quick response times.

LiDAR Sensor: Provides high-precision distance measurements using laser light, enabling the robot to detect obstacles at longer ranges and with greater accuracy.

Autonomous Navigation: Integrates sensor data to enable the robot to make real-time decisions for avoiding obstacles and navigating its environment.

Modular Design: The project is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for additional sensors or components to be added as needed.
